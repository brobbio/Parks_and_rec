8/10, Two shows in one , This show is really two shows  Pre season three and post season three   Before season three the show was like the office  the main character is an idiot doing the best they can but failing  The show has very awkward humor and is really funny   Post season three the show becomes very light hearted and goes for more the comedy the show is known for  It's about a smart capable main character who is a bit weird going against a bad system   The show is really good and it can be very funny but the change is jarring and I know people who only like post season three and people who only like preseason three  I think this is also reflected by some reviews   I recommend the characters are awesome      out of     found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
10/10, Forget the haters, Just watch it for yourself  I was drawn in by Amy Pohler  someone I didn't really like before I saw this show  and i stayed because of the beautifully drawn characters  Because they're deep characters  they're not gonna slam you over the head with comedy  This ain't My Name Is Earl  people  The show's funny  but in a real  get to know everyone kind of way   Even though I loved it  I'd say the first season stumbled a bit  but the second season gets funnier with every episode  Try it out  I bet you'll like one character right off the bat  and if you're like me you'll end up loving them all      out of     found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
9/10, Addictively funny, Once you get into this one you can't stop  So be aware of what you are doing      episodes are ahead  I am at number    and still laughing every episode  Although this series is set in a local government scenario  many things are painfully recognizable from other office environments  For lovers of mockumentary style entertainment this is a must see     out of    found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
9/10, One of my favourite sitcoms, I watched this right after I watched the office and didn't expect it to be on the same level  But it's better than the office in some ways  I personally like the office better but parks and rec is so much more consistent  every season was great and the writers knew when to end the show unlike a lot of tv shows  they could've done   more seasons that were average but they ended it at the right time  Another great thing about this show is that I like basically every character personally I love April  Andy and Ron but Iike all of them  If you haven't watched this yet you need to it's one of the best sitcoms ever   Season         Season         Season         Season         Season         Season         Season           out of    found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
10/10, Cute Where The Office is Awkward, This show is basically a cute version of The Office  If you haven't seen The Office  it is a hilarious show that is filmed like a documentary  It has a weird vibe because all of the characters seem to know that the cameras are there  They also give asides to the camera which are always funny  The asides in Parks and Recreation are funnier than those from The Office  They seem to be more of a showcase for the actors to show off their comedy  not additions to the plot   One thing that turns some people off about The Office  that is to say  what sets it apart from other shows   is that it gets incredibly and hilariously awkward  What sets Parks and Recreation apart is that it is incredibly and hilariously cute  Where The Office makes your jaw drop before you burst into laughter  Parks and Recreation gives you a warm smile before you burst into laughter  It makes it a lot of fun to watch   Another subtle difference from The Office is that aside from Jerry  Parks and Recreation's version of The Office's Toby   is that all of the characters care deeply about one another   The cast of Parks and Recreation is far better than the admittedly stellar cast of The Office  Amy Poehler lights up the screen every time she is in view  Rashida Jones has much better on screen chemistry with this cast than she ever did during her stint on The Office  This show is incredibly lucky to have Aziz Ansari before he becomes a worldwide phenomenon  because he is well on his way  Don't even get me started on how perfect Nick Offerman plays his role as the motivated slacker  libertarian boss   In the end the haters will say  "Oh they just stole The Office's idea and put it in City Hall " That is a far to shallow of a response to such a deeply funny show that stands wonderfully on its own      out of     found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
10/10, Funniest show on TV  surprisingly , I was lukewarm on this show throughout the first season and for the beginning of the second  but the last few episodes have made this the funniest show on air for me  The humor is not always laugh out loud  but I can watch each episode a few times and find new things that make me laugh each time   The mayor is one of the funniest characters I've ever seen on a show  and April the intern is funny even when she isn't saying anything  Some of the cameos aren't very funny  but all of the basic elements are fantastic and improving each episode  The Office seems to be  very slowly  running out of steam but this show is definitely making up for it   There's quite a few bad reviews for this show  but I can't suggest it enough  It is the opposite type of humor from My Name is Earl  which it replaced   and I consider that a very good thing      out of     found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
9/10, Hilarious, Note  I have seen all   seasons   Before watching this show  I thought The Office was my favorite sitcom  Parks   Rec has now taken that title  After a rougher first season  each of the characters brings several laughs in every episode   If you only want to watch the glory moments  stop watching after season    Season   and   are still funny  but not at the level of the previous seasons     out of    found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
10/10, Very endearing  while absolutely hilarious , There is no doubt that one of the main inspirations of this show was The Office   you will realise this in the first minute of the first episode  However  instead of trying to copy the main points of that show's success  Parks and Recreation has come up with its very own recipe  Amy Poehler is amazing as the lead actress  she plays an extremely enthusiastic city official in a department filled with bludgers and lazy bums   What sounds a little lame actually becomes very endearing very quickly  all supporting characters have great story lines  and grow quickly with a light yet sometimes strangely moving plot  The dialogue is fantastic  every show will make you laugh out loud plenty of times  and the roughly    minutes of each episode are over way too quickly   I found myself re watching the whole two seasons immediately after I had finished them for the first time  and the show holds up easily  Each character gets enough screen time to stay interesting  and very quickly  the show establishes a Simpsons like range of in jokes and extras who add even more depth to the story   Before you know it  you wish your own city had such a department  and you will fall in love with Amy Poehler's stellar performance  An absolute must watch      out of     found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
9/10, Really Good Stuff, I'm surprised at how many people wrote negative reviews of this show despite it being my most looked forward comedy of the week  followed by the Office  Curb  Sunny in Phily  and the Peep Show   a great British comedy   The characters are unique and the comedy comes mostly from subtleties such as intonations  gestures  and camera glances  It's high end comedic stuff in my opinion  Though Arrested Development was untouchable in this regard  Boy AD was good   I suppose if you like trite predicable comedy  you wouldn't see it as funny  but the thing about this show is that's it's also fun to watch  the characters are very charismatic on screen  I think the casting was great  Is this    lines yet IMDb   A really great show      out of     found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink

10/10, Fantastic  A Classic In My Book, There are always a few television shows that seem to "define" a genre every decade or so  and considering Parks and Recreation finished its final run several months ago  I feel it important to revisit the show and the impact it left  Many times it was spurned as "The Office Rip Off" in its starting days  despite it being more of a brainchild of the writers than anything  It seems safe to say  that after more than seven years on the air  Parks and Recreation has carved its own spot amongst the quirky and well loved comedies that are hard to come across today   The show stars hard working public servant Leslie Knope  played by the amazing Amy Poehler  and a cast of humorous and memorable characters that navigate through bureaucracy and red tape in the local city government to complete projects  The most notable  and perhaps most powerful  asset of this show is its lovable and unforgettable characters  some that will leave you rolling your eyes and chuckling while others will simply make you smile in the most joyous kind of way  The cast has obvious chemistry amongst one another  and this certainly breaks through into the characters in ways that will make a viewer grow more attached to them   The humor of the show itself also sets Parks and Rec apart from other television shows  While it's apparent the first season struggled to differentiate itself from The Office's "awkward humor"  Parks found its stride in the simple "cute humor"  the kind that is so innocuous and dumb and simply "cute" that it becomes hard not to laugh at the bumbling antics of the Parks and Recreation branch of the city of Pawnee  The episodes are mixed with the right amount of comedy  wit  and actual drama and storytelling  each character is crafted with the perfect amount of depth  that really separates from other comedy shows that rely on cardboard characters with running jokes to spew the funny  Even in its heartfelt moments  there is always room for laughs  but it never pushes aside the rest of the characters or their development  If you find yourself immersed in Parks and Recreation  it is almost certain you will find yourself immersed with one  more  or maybe all characters   The simple genius  the style and passion this show was borne of  really marks it as a one of a kind show  one that may not have had all the high ratings or prime time slots or huge important newspaper reviews  but it became its own  and that's really what mattered in the end  After struggling in the shadow of The Office  and finding its stride in later seasons  Parks and Recreation became its own kind of wonderful recipe  one that delivered its own style of warmth and humor not found in many television shows  It may even define the style of comedy itself  after all  both Parks and The Office made famous the "mockumentary"  "talking heads" sort of humor that others are sure to try and replicate  What gave Parks and Recreation a "name" per say  is the fact that the characters were so much larger than life  the stories so innocuous and believable  that the avid viewer can begin to believe them too  and find that this show is as heartfelt  funny  and enjoyable as I found it           out of    found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
10/10, Better Each Time I Watch , There was a lot of anticipation for Amy Poehler's new series  at least around here there was  and after eagerly tuning in to the pilot episode and every episode since then  I can honestly say that it has lived up to my expectations   Parks and Recreation has a sort of dry humor  where the really funny parts are the awkward moments between Leslie  Amy's character  and other characters  It is truly Amy's strong point  as we saw during her  too short   run on SNL and in movies like "Blades of Glory" and "Baby Mamma"  Amy absolutely steals the show  but it might be just because that's how the show has been written  the supporting cast are all strong actors  and  with the right material  could all bring in huge laughs for the show   It is obvious when watching "Parks and Recreation" that there has been a lot of effort put forth to put out a great show  and I believe they have pulled it off  The show leaves me not only laughing hysterically but also rooting for Leslie and her committee  The show is a welcome addition to my weekly TV schedule  and is worth checking out more than once     out of     found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink

8/10, A show worthy of binging   but the last season had it's flaws, I really enjoyed this show right from season    It has a lot of heart  You would think a story about small town politics wouldn't be funny but it works   Even though the show is centered around Leslie as the main character it's really all the supporting characters that make this show great   I found though sometime during the last season things kind of fell apart  not sure if the show was abruptly cancelled but that what the last   or   episodes felt like  like there was no one steering the ship and the replacement captain was just some kid they pulled out of the engine room at the last second and told to not get anyone killed   Still a great show  family friendly tv that was enjoyable to watch for the second time  will probably run through it again sometime down the road    out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink

8/10, Better   Worse than the Office at the Same Time, This show will inevitably be compared to the Office  partially because of the similarities  the fact that its by the same producers  and that the show took over for the Office   For those of you that are not going to read this whole thing  here's what you should know                this is a great show that is definitely worth investing your time in  though there are several negative aspects that hold it back from being a true masterpiece   To go into more detail  lets get the cons out of the way  The show during its first season or two feels like it is trying to be the Office  Sure  that is probably natural  and it is certainly a pro that the show shakes that mold and becomes it's own thing  However  if I had to knit pick  here are my serious complaints with the overall story  First  several characters have problems that I just cannot understand why the writers did not change these aspects over time  Gary Gerry Larry  etc is UNFAIRLY bullied the entire show  For a show that uses a lot of progressive ideas  the idea of unnecessarily bullying him is just straight up wrong  Comparisons can be drawn to Toby from the Office  but Gerry is wrongfully mistreated  He's a nice character  and though he can be clumsy he never got his story arc to where he was actually respected  Tom  can be extremely annoying throughout most of the show  Maybe its just not my type of humor  but he is annoying  He evolves and matures over time  and its a wonderful arc  but almost every scene with him in the first   or so seasons is unbearable  His friends John Ralfio and his annoying sister are a waste of time  The last bit of complaints is the amount of immature fart jokes  You'd think you were watching some childish Cartoon Network show  Once or twice is fine  but talking about or showing farts is just disgusting and really sad that an adult show would stoop to that level   With that out of the way  let's talk about why I love this show  Like I said before  it becomes its own show as time goes on  Almost all characters change for the better  and the little expanding that happens welcomes fresh faces that add so much to the story  I knew Ron Swanson was an internet fan favorite  but I never knew how much I would fall in love with Chris  Rob Lowe's character  He is without a doubt the funniest character on the show  He steals almost every scene  Overall  the show has memorable characters  and almost all have their moments to shine  unlike the office  Cameos from famous politicians here and there doesn't hurt either   As the title says  Parks and Rec is better and worse than the Office at the same time  Unlike the office  almost every season is enjoyable  The final season or two of the office was almost unbearable to watch  while Parks and Rec ends on almost a high note  The characters are not as memorable or lovable as the Office's cast  but they still are solid characters  I recommend this show to anyone  It has it's setbacks for sure  and they cannot be overlooked  but this is worth some stretches of binging on Netflix  You will not regret it    out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink

8/10, Amy Poehler's Great , I have been a Saturday Night Live fan for too long  I like Amy Poehler as Leslie Knope  an idealistic parks and recreational director  for Pawnee  Indiana  The show is based about the parks and recreation department in a small Midwestern town  Amy Poehler should be on the list for Emmy nominees for Best Actress in a Comedy Series  She shines as Leslie Knope  I only wished that Lorne Michaels would start developing sitcoms with his Saturday Night Live alumni like Poehler and Tina Fey  It's worth the investment and we need to laugh in times like this more than ever  The show has a quirky  offbeat sense of humor and a supporting cast that doesn't seem familiar yet but I'm sure I'll recognize them in time  Anyway  guest stars like Megan Mullally is worth watching     out of    found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
9/10, Michael Schur's Most Consistant Show, I love Parks and Rec   maybe even more than the Office  which is definitely a hot take  I say that because while the Office does have higher highs  it has way lower lows  which I can't say the same about this show  Parks and Rec post season one is extremely consitent  although seasons     aren't as great  And that really isn't even me contradicting myself  it's just that seasons     are near perfect seasons  Also  the cast has so much chemistry together and it only gets better over time  Really  this is just a really good show and one of the greatest and one of my favorite sitcoms of all time             out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink

10/10, Rashida Jones and Amy Poehler are excellent , Parks and Recreation is a funny little show about the Parks department  I love the friendship of Ann Perkins and Leslie Knope  and it is nice to see Amy Poehler in another TV show after The Mighty B  I also love the chemistry of Aubrey Plaza and Chris Pratt  The only thing I don't like about this show is how much Jerry gets mocked or ignored  like how nobody liked his paintings in The Camel and Go Big or Go Home   Sometimes Jerry Gergich has his own moments to shine  but it is even sadder that Mark Brendanawicz had even less of a part in Parks and Recreation before Chris Traeger took his place  Paul Schneider quit because of creative differences on how to play his character  which is why Mark never came back at the end of the series  Overall  I still enjoy watching most episodes of Parks and Recreation more so than The Office  which I have never watched  and I like most of the diverse cast of Parks and Recreation  I am glad that Adam Scott was wrong about Parks and Recreation being reunion proof  but the actors making a new money raising episode from their homes made me pay closer attention how many characters had their homes appear in the series proper before they moved out and got a new home  which I know Leslie  Ann and Chris all did  but it may not be the case for everyone else    out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink

10/10,  imo  better than The Office, Previously to watching Parks and Rec  The Office held the title of my favorite show  After I watched it however  it beat it out by a mile  Where as the Office begins to sag in the later seasons  I find that this show  while still has a bit of a drop in greatness  still holds up well  and I found myself rewatching it   times  There is a bit of a shift in the show  there's pre season   and post season    which don't get me wrong  are both great  but are different enough that it might put some people off  but it's still definitely worth the watch and I do recommend it    out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink

9/10, Parks and Recreation, I've tried to watch this show before but could only watch a couple of episodes and I'd give up  In my defense the   season  if you can call it that  is not good at all  But this time I kept watching and I'm so glad I did    season starts a bit slow but halfway through you don't want anything else  It makes you laugh constantly  you get to know the characters a bit more and start to relate to them  I already knew some of the actors like Aziz Ansari  Adam Scott and Nick Offerman  which helped starting but honestly it was Amy Phoeler who kept me going and the biggest surprise of all  Christ Pratt  I did not know this goofy innocent side of him and it was  to me  the funniest character in the show  consistently delivering alonside Aubrey Plaza  who was unknown to me either  This tv series surprised me a lot on the positive side and I can't tell you how happy I was when they announced the special quarantine episode  One more episode after the "last" episode  The first few seasons  the   being the exception  are the funniest and then it starts to get more dramatical and serious  life goes on and so do the characters  I trully recommend you go see it    out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
10/10, The cute  in a good way  version of "The Office", A documentary style sitcom  "Parks and Recreation" is a show about the lives of the Parks and Rec department in Pawnee  Indiana  specifically Leslie Knope  Amy Poehler  as she strides to make the most out of her position in the department  At first glance  it feels like a spin off to "The Office" and it isn't until the premiere of the second season that the show starts to take shape with Poehler being the most lovable character on the show  Ron Swanson  Nick Offerman  becomes everyone's mood and Andy Dwyer  Chris Pratt  well  you can't hate Chris Pratt  While other characters of the show never feel left out or just side characters as everyone gets their chance to shine during the seven season run  In my opinion this show has some great running gags and with a rocky start but a perfect ending this show was simply awesome    out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink

10/10, One of the best feel good comedies I have seen, I never realized this was on  caught a few minutes towards the end of the series and didn't 'get it' but that's because I hadn't been with these characters through their growth of many seasons  Caught the pilot in syndication and loved the characters  This is a show that doesn't become weak and lazy as it advances in seasons  you learn and love them all as the years progress and the writing is fantastic  You see yourself a little in each character  sometimes aloof like Ron or inspired like Leslie or just looking to live a high life like Tom and Donna  The story keeps progressing and new stories are added  I can not recommend this show any more than    stars as I would give it     I enjoy the reruns and if I have ever found a better series finale I can't think of one  Leslie's 'gift' to Ron in the final episode had me crying      out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink

9/10, Quality stuff, As sitcoms go  "Parks and Recreation" is certainly on the more refreshing side of things  Incidentally  I was drawn to this show when "The Office" took a dive  and I haven't looked back  It's a great staging area for mocking the Midwest  I like living here  but it's deserved   and even still  the producers seem to have an affinity for small town American       so it all evens out in the end   But at its  oversized  heart  this is a show where everybody pulls together to fix a problem   and when that's centered on government  sentimentality or no  that's an angle we should all be able to get behind  It's just so damn optimistic  and that can do attitude is personified by Amy Poehler  A more likable character  or actress  you'll be hard pressed to come by   Also  Ron Swanson  who's probably the best sitcom character we've seen in decades          out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
7/10, A lackluster pilot that may just turn into a great series , Filmed in mockumentary style by the creators of The Office  it at first seemed like Parks and Recreation could be a spin off  Well  it's not  Not only does the casting of Rashida Jones  The Office's Karen  confirm this  it also feels like a completely different show  The characters and situations feel far less natural and far more wacky  but they may not be such a bad thing   Amy Poehler was very entertaining as Leslie Knope  however the rest of the characters were rather uninterestingly portrayed by otherwise interesting actors  Not to worry  as I can already see the way some of these characters will devolope  and I like where it's going   The first half of the Pilot was light on laughs but you could faintly see where this series might go  Things picked up in the second half  and left me wanting to see more  although not necessarily in a good way  as the Pilot episode felt too short and incomplete    Now compared to the two episodes of The Office shown with the Pilot  it was pretty flat  But remember  even The Office had a rough start way back in Season     Overall  it's a shaky start to what may just be a great series     out of    found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
5/10, I hate every character , 
2/10, Funny in Rare Moments, 
5/10, "Park   Recreations" Aren't Funny , 
1/10, I'd rather eat my socks than watch a full season of this crap , After watching a couple of episodes I realize this is EXACTLY the same as The Office US  only without actors who are capable of making something out of nothing  The filming is exactly the same as The Office  the humor is way too predictable and lame   The characters are cliché  and the jokes are just too easy  If there were some actors who could act  then maybe this show becomes "watchable"  but since I don't see that happening  you should just avoid watching this  There is no originality in this show  I can't imagine anyone watching this   I wouldn't watch the Office  and this show is about    times worse than that  It's just   well   terrible     out of    found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
3/10, So bad  even an Office sandwich can't make it palatable, NBC did its best on Thursday by sandwiching Amy Poehler's new sitcom in between two highly anticipated episodes of THE OFFICE  I fell prey to the tactic and watched the new show  but I can guarantee NBC that I will not be making that same mistake twice   Amy Poehler has had a successful career so far doing sketch comedy on SNL  where she has often played wacky characters  So what do the makers of P R do  They make her more or less the "straight man" in an ensemble cast  where her main job is to look wide eyed and naive  And what an ensemble    Completely forgettable  except for Rashida Jones who I think I only remember because of THE OFFICE  Compare the characters on OFFICE or    ROCK with the duds on P R and you'll know why this show has a zero percent chance of success   And shame on the producers of THE OFFICE for exporting the hand held  phony documentary approach into this new sitcom  Is that all they know how to do  It was inappropriate for the material  and wasn't even handled consistently   Another reminder to them is that sitcoms by definition require a "situation " The vague plot line of episode one leads me to believe that they don't have much of an idea of where this show is going  It would be torture suitable for Gitmo to drag out the "let's build a park" idea any further than this one episode  Please let this show die a quick death before Amy's career is forever stained by this unpleasant walk in the PARK     out of    found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
7/10, It could be amazing but   , When I first started watching this TV series was a like feeling fresh air  In a time where the comedies available are too much cynical  where to be mean is the trend I felt this show was something different  funny  cosy and sharing an important message about the importance of politics and the work with community  But after three or four seasons everything changed and there are   reasons I can't give a   or       The main character  Leslie  became almost unbearable  The good heart and almost naif from the beginning became envy  competitor  cynical and mean  It is true that almost all the other characters didn't change  Ron  Andy  April or Chris were 'themselves' until the end  But the soul of this programme  Leslie  just died  It was almost as she has made an attempt of seduction initially to reveal her dark side afterwards    The most important  this TV series legitimises bulling  I could not believe the treatment one of the characters  Jerry  was given  It was beyond the limits  It was like saying 'Bulling is funny just do it'  And I have to almost hate the series because of that   At the end I cannot give less than   because yes  the series has many funny at beautiful moments but it was like a waist of an amazing idea  This series could be brilliant    out of    found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
10/10, Do not judge it by the first season , I have never heard of Parks and Recreation until recently  I have never heard of Amy Poehler  Jim O'Heir or Aubrey Plaza  In fact it was Chris Pratt that led me to this show after seeing his role as Owen in Jurassic World         I found Parks and Recreation under his name under the "Known For" Section on IMDb  After a while I suddenly started to see the funny quotes on social media that related back to Parks and Recreation and I found the quotes to be quite hilarious  so I bought the first   seasons   I was a bit disappointed after watching the  st season  some parts made me giggle  but it wasn't as funny as I thought they were be  and I was thinking about returning the DVDs  but I thought I'd give it a second chance by watching Season     Best  Decision  I  Have  Ever  MADE  The show starts to kick off as you get to know the once minor characters such as April  Donna and Jerry Gary Terry and whatever else there was for the poor bastard  And of course there is Ron Swanson  My absolute favourite character of the show  I realised that once you got to see more of him the show just improved by like a billion   I find this show to be an absolute treat and I am currently re watching it all for a second time and I still find myself laughing harder than I did the first time  It is perhaps one of the funniest and smartest comedies known to date and I am so glad that I have come across it  The characters bring something different to the show with their different personalities and their ideas  morals etc   So please  if you are judging this by the first season  PLEASE KEEP WATCHING  I promise you the show improves and you will find yourself watching one episode after the other non stop  It is an absolute treat    out of    found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
3/10, NBC Has Gone Green, At least that would explain the repackaging of discarded The Office scripts into a show with virtually the same format  with a female Michael   This was such a very disappointing show  I absolutely LOVE Amy Pohler  and I like Greg Daniels  and was hoping for much more from the pairing of these two for Parks and Recreation  but the pilot episode was so weak  Situated between The Office and    Rock  would be setting up virtually any show for success and having these people involved with the show  should have been a home run  Had they applied any effort  instead of taking the lazy  rehash way out   Very disappointing     out of    found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink

1/10, The office, Let me start by saying that I really enjoy many  many US comedies    But this is certainly not one of them   If you have seen the office  American version  then you have already seen this show    It is identical  The problem is that Americans cannot do this type of comedy    The whole point of this type of comedy is that when you watch them you are meant to think that they are real  Parks along with the American Office are both terribly overacted and where the humour is meant to be subtle it is in your face  or worse yet it is that annoying American zaney tripe   Absolutely awful     out of    found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink

2/10, Wow   Might be the Worst Show Ever , I give this show about   weeks  It is so bad  I might not watch The Office  just in case I get up from the couch and forget to change the channel and it comes on my television   Amy Poehler needs to go where most female comedians end up  doing stand up at  am on Comedy Central  I believe the only reason for this  is because of Title    Comedy Central has to let women comedians perform  There should be warnings before the broadcast     WARNING  WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO WATCH WILL NOT BE FUNNY  THERE MAY BE SOME ATTEMPT AT HUMOR  BUT PLEASE DON'T LAUGH BECAUSE IF YOU DO  YOU REALLY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HUMOR REALLY IS  YOU SHOULD GO TO BED INSTEAD     I am disappointed that Aziz Ansari and Rashida Jones got caught up in this catastrophe  Ansari is hilarious and his career will continue to flourish  You can't keep someone that sarcastic down for very long  This show will be the low point of his career  Jones was vastly underused in the pilot episode  It is very clear that she is the "Parks and Recreation's" Jim Halpert  Both Jones and Ansari need get out while they still can  Let Poehler go down with this ship   I have an idea  how about an original idea NBC  We already have "The Office " We don't need a crappy Office     out of     found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink

10/10, Parks and Recreation reigns supreme in the sitcom comedy genre , While Parks and Recreation may not have the awards and ratings of its predecessors  it still manages to provide absolutely hysterical comedy that just brings out that good feeling  Parks and Rec's greatest strength has to be its superb cast  Unlike The Office  most supporting cast members are developed enough to become the main subject for any given episode  The supporting cast  at times  even triumphs over the main cast  While the main cast of Parks and Rec might be smaller  these characters still Pack A Punch  Amy Poehler and Nick Offerman's great deliveries provide a countless number of quotable  classic lines  The stories of each Parks and Rec episode tend focus on very interesting plots that help keep the show fresh and consistently funny  Overall Parks and Recreation is by far the BEST television show I have watched in history  and I look forward to the show ending with a bang in its  th and final season      out of    found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink

7/10, A decent show at best, This show is definitely filled with some great moments  that many people will find funny  But the repetitive nature and lack of story  hinders the show from being anything groundbreaking  Along with the show the office  they both took a little bit to find their stride    But even after parks and recreation found theirs  it still did not feel special  The main character Leslie  went from a stupid kind of funny  always making mistakes  to just flat out annoying  Granted  the show definitely benefited from the portrayals of Andy and Ron  played by Chris Pratt and Nick Offerman  who seemed to really liven the show up and get a few good laughs  There are other great characters in the show  who had a lot of potential but from the lack of story  didn't really matter in the end  This show has many flaws but can some times be found enjoying and if u are able to look past these flaws  I would recommend watching a couple episodes    out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
10/10, Funniest ensemble ever on TV , Parks and Recreation started out a little too bland for some people's taste but stick around  trust me  it will be the most flavorful show you have ever seen   The premise is new  It is centered on government  friendship  career  feminism  set up into a mockumentary  The thing that stood out the most in this show would be the amazing cast   Ron Swanson  April Ludgate  Leslie Knope  Andy Dwyer  Ben Wyatt  These are the characters that we can all relate too  You may be a "Ron Swanson" but admit it or not  there are day when you feel like you are an "Andy Dwyer" or a "Leslie Knope"  One person can absolutely relate to more than one character and that's what made it so loved by the audience   I love the fact that it is doesn't show the typical premise of comedy show  like long pregnancy plot  giving birth plot  long courting plot  big and grand wedding plot  Parks and Recreation stays away from all those clichés  it stands on its own premise  Something new  something I have never seen on a TV show   I am sad to see this show go but the finale is absolutely amazing and I could not ask for a better one to conclude the great story of the people of Pawnee            out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink

8/10, Amy Poehler need ed  a committee to improve the script  but not anymore , I'm editing my review which is now into season two  Time has changed my opinion  So I'll edit this paragraph only and leave the rest to stand as what I felt about the show when it began  Right now I'm bordering on loving this show  the way the characters are starting to flesh out is great and the writing has definitely improved a lot in season    One of my favourite comedies now and I'll sorely miss it if it gets cancelled  Shame on me for reviewing it so early and hating on it   I find Amy Poehler to be one of the funniest women in comedy today but she deserves so much better  than to try and carry this poorly written and badly cast show  I want to give it the benefit of the doubt  having only seen one episode  but already it seems clear the mockumentary that worked so well in the Office  is falling flat here   The problem I think stems from the lack of understanding as to why the Office is funny  Having a great lead is part of it  and they nailed that  Some of the writing is pretty good  with moments designed to make you laugh  feel pity and embarrassment  which are all key ingredients in the Office but mostly the script is poor   Where things really fall down are in the setting  the casting and the script   The Office appealed to me because it was set in a generic workplace that I could relate to  More importantly it was an open plan space where the camera could relate moments from character to character around the office  which felt natural  Parks and Recreation relies on staging groups of employees from scene to scene which feels just like any other situation comedy  The documentary feel is lost   The casting was truly dire  despite the talents of Amy leading the show  The rest of the cast are mostly strange stereotypical blobs that really do not work at all  I'm just not interested in them  they don't come across as real people with all the vulnerabilities you need to mimic that Office mockumentary feel   And then there is the script  I do wonder if some of the people that worked on the US Office  who are working on Parks and Recreation actually understand why the scripting is so funny in the Office  Clearly when great UK comedy moves to the US  it often falls flat on its face  as the British sense of humor gets lost in translation  With the Office US  Ricky Gervais was there to help it transition  and while I feared the show would still be terrible  I was so wrong and now rate the US version much higher than the UK one  I guess without Ricky behind it  Parks and Recreations script has just run off down its own US centric situation comedy path   Maybe later in the series  the writing will shine through  I'll probably be sticking around to find out  if just to see where Amy Poehler takes us     out of    found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink

6/10, Falls Flat, Parks   Rec is by no means a bad show  but it has some serious flaws  and I think it definitely falls flat  especially compared to other contemporary shows   The biggest problem is the writing  Most of the actors are playing their characters pretty well  but the dialogue is often really stilted and out of place  The chemistry of the show is unbelievable   as in I could not believe that any of the supposed couples of the show were in love  I could totally buy the Leslie Knope and Ben Wyatt were friends  but the only chemistry they shared was Leslie weirdly and constantly insisting on seeing his butt  That doesn't make me believe they're in love  it makes me believe that they're actors who are reading lines that are poorly written   The bad writing extends to beyond simple romance  Many of the main characters act out of character  like  all the time  Andy is portrayed as a regular guy of below average intelligence most of the time  but sometimes he goes full retard  No real justification is given for all the characters hating on Jerry Garry Gergich  and the "joke" comes across as very mean spirited  It seemed like it was copying Michael Scott's attitude towards Toby  but that joke worked because Michael was just really self centered and Toby was a killjoy  and nobody else seemed to dislike Toby that much  When everyone ganged up on Jerry Garry simply for being clumsy or a push over or farting  that's not funny  It's harsh and unkind   Despite this  the show is very serviceable  Nick Offerman's character  Ron Swanson  is probably the best thing to come out of the show  his dead pan delivery being spot on  Most of the characters are likable  if not well developed  Tom is really the only one who has an arc  Most of the others are throw away gags  Craig shouts and is gay  Perd Hapley says things very literally  Councilman Milton is old  Councilman Jamm is a jerk  Chief Hotate is an Indian  Ethel Beavers is old  etc  Even the main characters suffer from poor characterization  with Donna often playing the 'Sassy Black Lady ' Ben Wyatt being a nerd  Chris Traeger as super fit  etc  The writing was really bad between Anne and Leslie as well  as the only way they could prove that they were friends was to have Leslie praise her all the time   I'm getting off track  The show is decent  and does manage to be timely in some episodes  It does bring up some current issues and give commentary on them  But  again  so many jokes were just  "Hey  look at this cameo  hurr durr  Bill Murray was the mayor all along  Hey  here's half of Key   Peele  Look  it's Vice President Joe Biden  Look  it's John McCain  Isn't that funny  Look  it's Will Arnett  It's funny because Amy Poehler is dating him in the show and married to him in real life "  Yet another nitpick I'm going to give the show is really poor drunk acting  There were at least a dozen times on screen characters were supposed to be drunk  and they tried to act like they were drunk  but ended up looking like actors pretending to be drunk   I'm sorry  I just can't get over the awful chemistry  It doesn't help that there are like    on screen couples  Garry and Gale  Donna and Joe  Tom and Lucy  Chris and Anne  Leslie and Ben  Ron and Diane  Craig and Typhoon  Andy and April  all of them had virtually no chemistry  I didn't believe anybody was really in love  not once   Look at this show at face value  It's a slightly funny  slightly quirky sitcom about some fine characters who are given nothing to do    out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink

9/10, Sister show of the Office, To start  I love both the Office and Parks and Recreation  I think the shows are the best comedies along with Modern Family that have taken place since       The shows provide unique story lines that really develop the characters and romances with effortless comedy mixed in  One of the bright points of both shows is the writing where most shows struggle with this   Parks and Recreation provides a very cute aspect of a career driven woman in a city that could care less about the parks department  I think the show maintained a solid performance all the way through the series and while Andy never seemed to get any more intelligent and Tom seemed to get more and more whacky it didn't take away from the overall direction of the show   The Office draws a lot of its humor from the sheer awkwardness of the situations and while Parks and Rec does this to a certain extent a lot of the humor is derived from the individual performances and not necessarily the plot that unfolds  Would highly recommend this show to anyone that found the Office funny or anyone that is willing to give a comedy a chance    out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink

5/10, Annoying  watered down Office, This show just annoys me  Amy Poehler annoys me  Everything about this show screams "Office rip off " Every character seems like a two dimensional  lifeless carbon copy of sitcom tropes that seemed to have worked in the past  Some parts make me laugh  but it's the premise alone  All of the characters are so annoying that not much besides the story  occasionally  are funny    out of    found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
10/10, Great  but needs work   , I can see why some people don't like this series and even I  someone who dislikes "The Office"  enjoyed this series so far  At first i wasn't so sure about the casting for the leading role but after a few episodes she has really grown on me  and her facial expressions in themselves can make otherwise pointless scenes seem worthwhile and hilarious  The storyline is great and makes usually boring situations quite humorous  Aziz Ansari seems to be the best character in the show however and it is his scenes that really propels the show from smile to laugh out loud  So overall with a bit of work this series could go far   Oh and the supporting female character is really hot    out of    found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink

9/10, Pure Perfection, The thing that really makes this show amazing is its characters  There are very few shows out there that put this much dedication into crafting a set of characters you'll fall in love with  Some of the episodes may miss  although most of them do hit   but it doesn't really matter because the characters are just so lovable   Once you get into this show  you won't regret it  Season   is kind of weak so get past that  and you'll enjoy it    out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
7/10, Cute fun , This is a very pleasant show  It is less original than The Office  but it balances that with much more fully rounded characters and a more cuddly feel  It is sweet  to use that word in its most positive sense  It doesn't really try to do much beyond make you laugh but that is all I can really expect   It takes a while to get started  and Season   is probably the worst out of any of them  but it rapidly improves  Leslie comes into her own and becomes a bubbly and hilarious character  surrounded by a cast of wonderful actors  Aziz Ansari  Rasida Jones  and Christ Pratt and all do a great job  as does some of the more minor actors like Jim O'Heir and Ben Schwartz    I binged this while sick in January          out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
10/10, One of the Best Shows to ever grace television , 
8/10, Not perfect  but certainly worth watching, I had heard the resounding "Meh" that has come from the internet in regards to this show  so going in I was not expecting to be wowed  and I wasn't  But I was pleasantly surprised   Amy Poehler's character is a lot like Michael Scott  oblivious  enthusiastic with a lot of heart  I thought the college intern and Aziz Ansari's characters teasing and bating her was hilarious  Rashida Jones did what I expect she wanted to do  which was play a very normal person in a sea of people who are just a little crazy   Honestly  it doesn't have that crazy  laugh out loud funny that the early seasons of The Office did  It's certainly no Diversity Day  What it does have is a lot of potential  and I think it would definitely be worth it to see where it takes us     out of    found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
7/10, Great viewing   deteriorates after season  , Got caught up in this during lockdown and binge watched  The first few seasons were hilarious  goofy  my family really enjoyed them  Season   started and we noticed we were not laughing as much and some of the stories seemed desperate  Before we knew it we became aware we weren't looking forward to sitting down and watching as much  We soldiered on  loyal followers and fans  As we started season    the characters were unrecogniseable  the topics more serious and became sickly sweet  pretty much wasting our time  stretching out stories to make a season that was obviously coming to an end and not going to be renewed  Just to make sure we weren't alone I began googling season   and realised we were not alone  so half way through it  we flagged it  Not wanting to even see what happens at the end  and have no regrets  Classic example of a dead horse being flogged  the writers and creators had clearly run out of ideas  The term 'jump the shark' came to mind when the crew took up jobs in Inidana but were still based in Pawnee     say what    silly    out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
7/10, Gets better in the end, Parks and Rec is basically two shows with same name  There is one "experimental" season one and then the later seasons  Both are likeable in their own sense  In first season  the characters are more cynical and ill mannered  Knope  for instance is a dim minded under achiever in season one but pater becomes this lovable leading lady  Same happens with every other character  They get their own human touch in the later episodes    out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink

1/10, The Office without all that pesky comedy , I know this was created by the same people who made The Office but that's no excuse for trying to make it the exact same show I'm sure at the pitch meeting for this they were very concerned that The Office wouldn't last forever so they had to make a new one A new Office Then they talked about how most people who watch TV are idiots and they won't even notice that it's a total rip off The moronic public will praise it as comedic genius Wish I could have been at that meeting The casting was even more ridiculous They got lucky with The Office when they cast a bunch of unknowns and non comedic actors  why not just do that again Aziz Ansari is the only person on the show who was ever funny but that was in his stand up act He won't make you laugh in this mess Where they really screwed up was adding Rashida Jones to the cast She was by far the worst character on The Office What were they thinking Oh yeah  they were thinking you are stupid I think they were right     out of    found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
9/10, "Parks and Recreation"  Wanna Laugh , "Parks and Recreation" is being compared to "The Office" and is said that it does not meet "The Office" criteria and or this show is a wannabe "The Office"  These comments are more hilarious than the show itself  How can this show be a wannabe when it comes from the same producers of "The Office"  I won't bring down "The Office" fans because I've never seen the show   Anyways  seeing the Pilot of "Parks and Recreation" and continuous episodes  I think they couldn't have cast a better group of characters  The characters put so much life into the show  You have one character who makes you chuckle  and another who simultaneously backs the chuckle up with a hysterical laugh   I also enjoy the theme of the show and how the Parks Department of the show helps to make the city of Pawnee a better place for everyone  environmentally speaking   Amy Poehler does an amazing job performing her character as Leslie Knope  Her comedic intellect in the show just makes you want to laugh  She performs actions of her character that the character herself doesn't find funny  but the viewers do   I also think the other characters of this show really are the gravy and corn to the Turkey  Nick Offerman does great portraying his character of seriousness and boss like business  Aziz Ansari is also another hilarious character who  if this show didn't have  it wouldn't be as comedic  Aubrey Plaza  who portrays April  is quite amusing also  Her speechless facial expressions  show off the other characters stupidity   This show is nothing compared to anything else on television  The Parks department of this show is superb and no other characters of any other show can compare to this show's optimistic and comedic cast    out of    found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink

10/10, To be honest   , Out of all honesty    I have watched the mockumentary The Office over    times through and through and I dont miss anything     I have heard many mixed reviews of Parks and Rec over the years and I started it about   times but just could not get through   episodes    I finally took advice from others and I pushed my hardest through the  st season    Thankfully after the   season it picked up and to be honest this show is one of the greatest shows of all times  It has through all seasons so many famous celebrities  like ginuwine  the decemberists  jon hamm  kristen bell  michell obama  joe biden  john mccain  roy hibbert  John Cena  Bill Murray and so many more  This is one of the best mockumentaries that really shows character development through   years of a characters life  the emotional  and physical changes  pregnancies  divorces business ventures etc    but they kept up the story line all the way through and it made it better each season  The relationship Ben and Leslie has is truely sincere and honest and  relationshipgoals  You have to have a macho man Ron Swanson  is the greatest fatheresque human who has a loving heart  Leslie is a perfect character for wanting to infect change and she is the epitomy of happiness and doing everything for everyone  and she and Ron have a father daughter relationship that is one for the making   Overall this show makes you smile  LIL sebastian    it brings joy to your heart of how good it is  To be honest    it fell a bit overboard after season   where it should have ended but it wasnt horrible  Anyway GREAT show    out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink

9/10, Started off slow  but didn't The Office , In a short summary of what I've seen from this show  it's always been entertaining  It started off a bit iffy  there were laughs here and there  but nothing too spectacular  My man crush on Aziz Ansari kept me watching  though  and thank god he did  because I've seen a huge improvement this past season  The acting has been spot on  I love how they've really involved the entire cast even more and brought more life to the characters since the start  Amy Poehler's once awkwardly unfunny role has done a total     into the well deserved spotlight  It's first season wasn't looking good  but even The Office started off unsure of itself  and it grew into its role as one of the funniest US comedy shows around today  "Parks and Rec" has earned its spot on NBC's Thursday comedy lineup  I can only see it getting even better from here    out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
9/10, Just choke down the first season, I don't like quiet  awkward  slow  uncomfortable humor  The first season of Parks and Rec is like that  so for years I avoided it  until I started seeing a few episodes towards the end of season   when a friend was watching it  I just picked it up from there and never looked back  The first season isn't terrible  it's just really uncomfortable  But from season   on  I swear  it is hilarious   but it's the kind of funny that's made sweeter by the fact that there is something likeable about every character  and every character is capable in their own way  and they grow and develop throughout the show  You'll find yourself wondering who among your friends is the "Leslie " who is the "Jerry" that everyone picks on  who's the "Ann Perkins " the "Ron Swanson " etc   all the characters are so different but so memorable  It does occasionally get a little over the top silly  but the characters react to the situations in ways that either make sense or are even more hilarious  So for people like me who couldn't get through the first few episodes  stick it out  There is not a bad actor in the bunch    out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink

10/10, A delightful  ''feel good '' show  Loved it , I just completed watching the series finale and I cried  This show made me feel good during bad times  it made me laugh even when I was low and forget my problems  It's the best show to just make you feel good and happy  Almost every character is very likeable  except in my opinion  April Ludgate  The humour is quite delightful  Not slapstick and over done  The story line is strong and stays unpredictable and interesting till the end  Unlike many other shows it didn't deteriorate as the seasons progressed but in fact got better  Every character was given importance and even the ones you may find annoying initially  turn out to be quite lovable  As I mentioned earlier the only imperfection and source of irritation to me on this show was the character April Ludgate  In real life rude  self centred  hateful weirdos with a grotesque sense of humour would be completely side lined and dislikes by everyone  not loved and portrayed as ''cool '' and ''brilliant ''   That's my only gripe  Leslie Knope is forceful  crazy and hyperactive but more than makes up for it by being a lovely person  Ben is sweet and adorable  as is Andie  Tom grows on you  But Ron really steals the show  I laughed  I cried and I loved  This was a beautiful  funny and sensible show with many important issues dealt with in a humorous way  I am sad to not have any more parks and recreation to watch  Guess I should watch the office again  Please and thank you   out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
10/10, A Show For Everyone To Laugh With  Learn With  and Enjoy, Parks and Recreation is comedy gold  with value  There's genuine laughs at every corner  Jokes are fired so effortlessly and quickly that they are not cheesy whatsoever  The show's humor is so ridiculous at times  in a good way   but the show also speaks truth about the world of politics  Main character Leslie Knope is a struggling female politician in her hometown of Pawnee  Indiana  who deals with issues that real politicians go through  such as unreasonable rumors  critical news anchors  and protests against her campaigns and ideas  However  the political theme of this show is presented in such a genuinely funny way that the show is not boring whatsoever  The main  and also supporting  characters  all have a real role in the cast  They each develop more and more throughout the series  and no character is left behind  References to past events from previous episodes are constantly being made  and the cast has such great chemistry that despite some of the crazy situations the cast finds themselves in  they're still very believable as people  I HIGHLY recommend watching this series  because it's rare to find a series that is truly funny  with a cast so purely likable    out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
9/10, yes  its similar to The Office but so what , I actually found this show to be very funny  Sure it is very similar to The Office  my favorite show   but is that a bad thing    Not in my opinion  And to the people that say Leslie is just a female Michael Scott  apparently you don't watch The Office enough to make that comparison  Michael is very insensitive and kind of an idiot most of the time  Leslie on the other hand  is perky  and is just trying to do what ever she can to help and is quite likable   Obviously people are going to compare it to The Office because NBC made the mistake of basically screaming that it was from the same people in its promos  but if there were no Office to begin with  people would most likely consider this as funny anyway  I kind of think of it like Joey and Friends  well Joey was quite awful  but if it wasn't Friends  then people didn't want anything to do with it  I love Amy Poehler and would love to see her continue on a sitcom with such a great cast  So please just give this show a chance and you might actually enjoy it as much as i do if you are willing    out of    found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink

10/10, Best Comedy Show on TV, Don't be fooled by the lower reviews  as they're comparing it to The Office  and have strange reasons for it not being as well done  "Americans can't do British TV"    This show may have similar audience types as The Office  but that's where the comparisons end   the characters are entirely different archetypes  each with their own storyline  character development  unique humor  and a reason for you to care about them  EVERY character is fully flushed out  which for me  actually sets this show above and beyond The Office  which I loved by the way  but I know believe this show is better based on character development alone   Also  if you found The Office to be awkward or difficult to watch at times  this show is all funny with no discomfort    out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink

10/10, An excellent comedy with not so sneaky emotions, Where to begin  This show is excellent  It starts off as a light  hearted comedy with quirky characters  each unique from one another  The antics are ridiculous but you will fall in love with everyone  But as the show progresses  something happens  Suddenly there are moments that aren't so goofy  They are real moments spilling over with emotion  Every character goes through so much change in the show  and nothing is forgotten  Not even something as small as a burrito related injury or a childhood diary  These characters undergo meaningful and emotional changes  improving upon themselves and becoming closer to their peers  SPOILERS AHEAD  SPOILERS AHEAD  Leslie tries time and time again to further her career into the government  Ron goes from a secluded man to a family man who reveals his secret musical identity for his friends and family and he even works for the    federal government  April and Andy slowly grow up  Andy gets two part time jobs and creates his own television show  April finally finds her dream job  Tom succeeds as a businessman and fails  only to succeed again  The list goes on  Watch this show if you enjoy goofy comedy and heartfelt situations    out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink

9/10, Hilariously well written, Parks and Recreation really is a hilarious show  with characters that could really seem annoying  but somehow turn out to be really cool and likable  It really goes to show just how well written this show really is  You have Leslie Knope  an overly ambitious Parks Department director  who is always leading the crew  and learning from her mistakes as she goes  but doesn't accept defeat with ease  and certainly doesn't take no for an answer  Ron Swanson  the man  the outdoors man  the meat lover  He hates government work  and loves building things out of wood  Tom Haverford  the entrepreneur  the very ambitious one at that  He's always looking to start his own business  rather than working in one  Andy Dwyer  the lovable  brainless  unintentionally hilarious one  He doesn't know much  but he means well  And who can forget his alter ego  Burt Macklin  FBI  No task is too difficult for him  April Ludgate  if it brings joy to people  she hates it  Although she does love animals  Donna Meagle  the sassy  independent one  She's loving  and can read you like a book  Ann Perkins  she's looking for men like a heat seeking missile  She often has difficulties finding the perfect man  no matter how nice or how beautiful and brilliant Leslie thinks she is  Chris Traeger  the inhumanly healthy one  He's always looking to help everyone with their problems  No matter how big or small  Chris would literally   do anything for anyone  Ben Wyatt  the smart  and nerdy one  He loves Game of Thrones  and is always worrying that Star Wars Episode   is going to rely too heavily on CGI  but he's always the man with a plan when one is needed  Then you have Jerry Gary Larry Terry Gergich Gingerch  He's a nice man  and is always looking to help out  no matter how badly he screws everything up  Although he does has a suspiciously good looking family  Each and every one of these characters are extremely well written  and work so well together  even though they all seem so different  It just shows what a great job Michael Schur did writing this series and I certainly cannot wait to see Season           out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
10/10, Most amazing show ever , This show is so freaking good  It was just about two months ago that i saw a gifset of some of April Ludgate's  Aubrey Plaza  jokes  I thought it seemed like a funny show and decided to watch it  Today  I've already re watched the show thrice  I like to tell people that it's the perfect mix between drama and comedy  I mean  the characters are all so well written and have personal problems and relationships etc but the writers always still manage to make every episode FUNNY  Parks and recreation is my go to show at any time for any mood  when I'm sad it cheers me up  when I'm happy it maintains my happiness  I honestly have no idea why terrible shows like "The Big Bang Theory" are super popular but amazing shows like this one are underrated  And not only is it amazing and funny and awesome  it also brings up important feminist topics  especially in episodes like "Women in garbage" and "Pie Mary"   Parks and recreation is the best show ever  and Leslie Knope is the best character on TV ever  Your argument is invalid  Goodbye    out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
9/10, One of the funniest shows I have ever seen,  Parks and Recreation             series review   Parks and Rec is a comedy series that looks at a group of public workers as the parks and rec department of their local town Pawnee  Indiana  Taking many noted from The Office  Parks and Rec takes a somewhat more absurd approach to this show  adding room for some sharp over the top satire about small government  consumers  town hall meetings  etc    I love this show so much  It is funny  smart  likable  and full of some really memorable charters I will get to soon  If the comedy scene is not your thing  that is okay  I just reviewed Daredevil  But this is not Daredevil  it's Parks and Rec   The series plot varies a lot  making it easy to jump into  minus a few character subplots  I love the way the story progresses along with the character changes  And the moments it gets absurd  it is never to absurd it is unbelievable  just absurd to the extremes of realism  For example  Woman complains about snails  Absurd  but not unheard of  Satire to a 'T    Each episode is only twenty minutes  minus a few finales  so it is easy to accidentally watch eleven episodes in one night  Not that that happened to me or anything   I am going to combine acting and characters for this next part  Parks and Rec stars Amy Poehler as Leslie Knope  a workaholic  dedicated  somewhat crazy deputy director at the department  Amy Poehler does a job worthy of the Golden Globe she won for it  I also totally love the character of Leslie Knope  She is annoying at times  but so lovable and heartfelt  She's also a serious liberal  so if you are one of those extreme people who hates every mention of Joe Biden because you think it promoted how wonderful Democrats are  it is just a TV show  Leslie Knope is aided by Nick Offerman as Ron Swanson  an anti government  anti people  pro meat guy who would rather build a canoe with his bare hands than listen to someone discuss their feelings  Nick Offerman is hilarious and my favorite character on a show full of wonderful characters  And then there is Aubrey Plaza as April Ludgate  a younger  sarcastic intern turned secretary who hates everything but dogs and Andy  Chris Pratt plays Andy Dwyer  who is a child like idiot with a really big heart  He offers a lot to the show in both the comedy area and some really meaningful moments  plus we would not have Burt Macklin  FBI or Johnny Karate without him  Aziz Ansari is Tom Haverford  Like I am pretty sure he is  In real life  Tom is an entrepreneur and is always coming up with self centered ideas  but his change throughout the show is another one of the many best things about it  Jim O'Heir plays Garry Jerry Larry Gergich  who is another lovable character whom everyone makes fun of because he is a walking klutz  Retta plays Donna Meagle  Treat Yo Self  Rashina Jones plays Anne Perkins  but moving on to more fun people  Rob Lowe is literally  the best City Manager in history  Chris Traeger is a very positive individual who is obsessed with fitness to the point of driving Ron Swanson mad  And finally  Adam Scott plays Ben Wyatt  who is a smart nerd who invents his own board game  knows everything about nerd trivia  and loves calzones  I may or may not be him    Finally moving on  There is not a lot of music because of the mockumentary style  but we do get some music in the way of Mouse Rat  Chris Pratt's band  The reoccurring songs The Pit  which is about how Andy fell in a pit  and Bye  Bye Li'l Sebastian  a memorial song for a pony  offer a lot of heart to the show  Somehow    I love this show  The more I watched  the closer I felt to the characters and story  It made my tear up several times  which is impressive for a comedy show  and it offers a lot of heart and a lot of laughs  I think it is a great show  No  I think Parks and Rec is  Amazingtastic   Parks and Rec is TV PG  but occasionally has some references and conversations that are in the PG    realm if it were a film  It also censors some language for humor's sake  And it has one minor character who  due to the insane nature  needs to be pixilated    out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
10/10, This show made me happy, I have never written a review before but felt like paying a tribute to this show   This is a sitcom with a much more intelligent humor than current popular shows like How I met Your Mother or Bingbang Theory but that is not what makes it truly special  What makes Parks and Recreation stand out is that it is tribute to family  hard work  dedication  and all things that makes America great   There are a lot of good shows out there and this one is one of them  It is also more than that  though  Its warm  hard working  optimistic characters are truthfully uplifting and will make you a better  happier person  Watch it    out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
10/10, We have to remember what's important in life  friends  work    and 'Parks and Recreation' , Let me start out by saying how insanely much I'm going to miss this show when it ends  I'm just glad it's been on this long because it very well deserves to be  I couldn't think of a better cast  all the actors are perfect for their role and are amazing at delivering their lines  It never fails to make me laugh  One of the things about comedies is keeping it funny  especially if it's been on for a long time  but the writers on this show never gets lazy and you can always depend on the new episode to be amazing  Another thing about comedies is sometimes they'll get  for lack of a better word  stupid and cheesy  but this is not the case here  There isn't just guaranteed comedy in each episode but hysterical comedy that makes you fall in love with these government employees  I highly recommend it    out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink

7/10, Does provide some recreation, This is a pretty decent show  Good jokes   fine acting from all the actors   But  sometimes the plotlines had too many plot holes  I also feel that the writers went overboard with some of the characters  Besides  the message of the show seems to be that if you are a good civil servant working in a small town  then you need to leave the said town   move to bigger cities   I liked those seasons which were more Pawnee oriented  but suddenly  all the characters got too ambitious   surprise surprise  all ended up being super successful too  That's lazy writing    out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink

5/10, Amy Pohler only light in dim sit com, Amy Pohler's character  a    year old city hall "up and comer" has just been appointed to the assignment of her career  Head of a committee to turn a hazardous abandoned construction site into a beautiful recreational park  Public support appears to be minimal  yet our heroine presses on   A side plot reveals the star's unrealistic ambitions to take public service all the way to the Oval Office  as well as an inferiority complex toward her mother  who  in contrast to young Amy  is a high ranking city official   I'm a big fan of the star  and I'm glad she didn't retire after having her baby and leaving SNL  The new show "Parks and Recreation"  styled after the extremely popular "Office"  offers a few laughs here and there  but leaves very little for anyone to anticipate and look forward to subsequent episodes   This is a spotlight for a very talented comedienne  but I see no chance for anything remotely comparable to "   Rock" coming from this humble sit com  Unless someone knows something I don't know  the buzz should fizzle long before a full season goes on the air    out of    found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
10/10, Ignore the haters , First time writing a review  I admit I may not write a comprehensive or well detailed one but some things bothered me  People are indulging themselves in debates about logic and character depth and decisions in this show  Parks and Recreation has great and memorable characters  But most importantly  it is a sitcom  It's not a fantasy saga like Game of Thrones that needs to be dissected and checked for plot holes  Honestly  if you want to be in a good mood  you can watch this show  It is an absolutely joyful ride  It makes you giggle  cringe  laugh out loud  smile  cry but most importantly  it makes you happy  No offense but if you are not a narcissist or egomaniac  you will fall in love with the characters  and this show  I thank the creators and the wonderful cast for their wonderful gift to the world  that is Parks and Recreation    out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink

10/10, Best Show Ever, This show is so great  and I love how they have created the fictional town of Pawnee  Indiana  If you haven't seen Seasons        you can watch them on Netflix's Watch Instantly feature in HD  They are really great   The best part of the show is all of the "minor" characters like April  Donna  Jerry  and Tom   Tom is played by Aziz Ansari  and he had a comedy sketch show on MTV called Human Giant  which was pretty funny  It was a lot like The State  a comedy sketch show that turned into Viva Variety  and then turned into Reno      and The Upright Citizens Brigade  which Amy Poehler was a member of  Members of The Upright Citizens Brigade sometimes appear on Parks and Recreation  I think     If you do a search for "Human Giant Predator"  you will get a video of a spoof of To Catch A Predator  with Aziz pretending to be a young  British boy  in order to catch a pedophile in the act   Amy Poehler is so convincing as an extremely earnest and hardworking Parks employee  Her love of her department and government sometimes blinds her to the mistakes she is making  but her intentions are always good   April is the worst assistant in history  which her boss  Ron Swanson  the actor who plays him is the real life husband of Megan Mullally  who played Karen Walker on Will and Grace   loves because he wants to dismantle the government so that it will not spend the taxpayers' money   April is played by Aubrey Plaza  and she is also good in Scott Pilgrim vs  The World   Her boyfriend on the show  Andy  Chris Pratt   is also in Wanted with James McAvoy and Angelina Jolie   Rashida Jones was great on The Office  and she is great as Nurse Ann on this show  The guy she dated in Season    Mark  is not on the show anymore  but he was pretty good so maybe he will return   The actors who play Donna and Jerry are great  Donna has the best lines every episode   The series has had great guest stars  such as Justin Theroux  from Sex and The City and Charlie's Angels  Full Throttle   Rob Lowe is on the show right now as a hyper healthy government official  The woman who played Leslie's mother in Season   was on a TV show called Grand  and she was also Arnold Schwarzenegger's partner in Kindergarten Cop  she had to pretend to be his sister    Megan Mullally  Karen from Will and Grace  played an employee of the Pawnee Public Library in   episodes  and she did a great job   The detail that goes into making the make believe town of Pawnee  Indiana  seem real is what is so great about the show   On Thursday nights  I love watching Community  The Office  and    Rock  but this is my new favorite show that I can't wait for    out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink

9/10, Perfection  Knope  But it's pretty darn close , I recently finished watching the Office  US and UK versions  and was told that I would love Parks and Recreation  P R  seeing as I found the Office truly brilliant  I wasn't aware that it followed a similar format of a documentary style comedy until I started episode    It soon became apparent that a new show would dethrone the current top  sitter of TV shows that make me laugh much as intravenous comedy could     P R is set in the small town of Pawnee and follows the local P R department  go figure   with Leslie Knope  Amy Poehler  as the main focus  Leslie  a work a holic  is surrounded by a team about as competent as tap dancing monkeys  Ron Swanson is a man I feel embodies the true outdoor American  with an added sense of paranoia and hatred towards the government  His jokes and one liners were so laugh out loud that I ended up watching a    minute compilation on Youtube from start to end  The other members of the team have their own unique features that provide another dimension to the show  In some cases  however  I felt that some of these quirks got annoying as they felt so over the top that they were detached from 'real life'  even though I appreciate this is a TV show    Each season had their own separate plot  with a few underlying core themes running throughout  Despite its negative press  I loved season    Of course  the show was still finding its feet and it felt slightly confused  However  since P R grew to become such an incredibly different  refreshing and diverse comedy show  it is understandable that its beginnings aren't        I believe it set a great foundation for later seasons as the concept of Leslie fighting a storm of opposers became engrained in our minds and the character development was great   Seasons     were genuinely comedy gold  I cannot think of   bad episode  I have seen people rank the seasons and I just do not see how one can rank seasons      They are just that good  Leslie's relentless nature  Tom's stupidity  Andy's idiocy  Ron's hatred of all things   the list goes on  Each element made every episode a true gem in their own right  Even thinking about some of the jokes makes me burst out laughing   Following this  season   fell a bit flat for me  I felt as though an already over the top show became even more detached from reality  It made it hard to relate to much of what season   had to offer as they were just that wacky  I also did not understand why other relationship changes were included altogether as it just confused me  For example  the falling out of   key characters  I won't spoil anything for you   What I did feel this season did well was the finale  It tied up all loose ends in a satisfying manner  which is something I felt many shows fall flat on   In summation  P R is a brilliant piece of television  The characters were brilliantly conceived  the main plot of each season was great and each episode was a true pleasure to watch  Leslie Knope wore me down and I must concede  P R is now my favourite TV show  Full stop    out of   found this helpful  Was this review helpful  Sign in to vote  Permalink
